5.) In the WSL terminal, create an account if its your first time. This requires you to put a username, hitting enter, then entering the password (NOTE: While typing the password in the terminal, the system is recording the keystrokes but does not show any typed characters [i.e. will appear blank but the password is in there when typed]), hit enter, then confirm the password by typing it again when prompted. 

6.) Close your WSL windows and re-open using the 'Run as Administrator option'

    cd software
    git clone https://github.com/ace-aerospace-lab/mae451.git


8.) run:

        cp /home/$USER/software/mae451/Windows/get_linux_packages.txt /home/$USER/software/mae451/Windows/get_linux_packages.sh

        cd /home/$USER/software/mae451/Windows
        ./get_linux_packages.sh

    (you may have to input your pasword and hit {Y, [enter]} a few times)

9.) In the wsl, run: 

    cd /home/$USER/software
    wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2024.10-1-Linux-x86_64.sh

(different versions can be found on repo.anaconda.com/archive/)

    cd /home/$USER/software
    bash Anaconda3-2024.10-1-Linux-x86_64.sh

At path:

    /home/$USER/software/anaconda3

(you may have to use your actual username instead of $USER here)

11.) Run the following:
